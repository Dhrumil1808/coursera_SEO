          <p>A frequently asked question in the SEO world is whether or not branding plays a part in Google's ranking algorithm. There's a short answer with a big asterisk, and in today's Whiteboard Friday, Rand explains what you need to know.

</p><p style="text-align: center;" class="caption">For reference, here's a still of this week's whiteboard. Click on it to open a high resolution image in a new tab!<br>
</p><h2>Video Transcription</h2><p>Howdy, Moz fans, and welcome to another edition of Whiteboard Friday. This week I'm going to try and answer a question that plagues a lot of marketers, a lot of SEOs and that we ask very frequently. That is: Is brand or branding a ranking factor in Google search engine?
</p><p>Look, I think, to be fair, to be honest, that the technical answer to this question is no. However, I think when people say brand is powerful for SEO, that is a true statement. We're going to try and reconcile these two things. How can brand not be a ranking factor and yet be a powerful influencer of higher rankings in SEO? What's going to go on there?
</p><h3>What is a ranking factor, anyway?</h3><p>Well, I'll tell you. So when folks say ranking factor, they're referring to something very technical, very specific, and that is an algorithmic input that Google measures directly and uses to determine rank position in their algorithm.
</p><p><img src="./Is Brand a Google Ranking Factor_ - Whiteboard Friday - Moz_files/5567a092b817e9.04909515.jpg">
</p><p>Okay, guess what? Brand almost certainly is not this.
</p><p>Google doesn't try and go out and say, "How well known is Coca-Cola versus Pepsi versus 7 Up versus Sprite versus Jones Cola? Hey, let's rank Coca-Cola a little higher because they seem to have greater brand awareness, brand affinity than Pepsi." That is not something that Google will try and do. That's not something that's in their algorithm.
</p><p>However, a big however, many things that are in Google's ranking algorithm correlate very well with brands.
</p><p><img src="./Is Brand a Google Ranking Factor_ - Whiteboard Friday - Moz_files/5567a0ba0810e4.34653534.jpg">
</p><p>Those things are probably used by Google in both direct and indirect ways.
</p><p>So when you see sites that have done a great job of branding and also have good SEO best practices on them, you'll notice kind of a correlation, like boy, it sure does seem like the brands have been performing better and better in Google's rankings over the last four, five, or six years. I think this is due to two trends. One of those trends is that Google's algorithmic inputs have started favoring things that brands are better at and that what I'd call generic sites or non-branded sites, or businesses that have not invested in brand affinity have not done well.
</p><p>Those things are things like links, where Google is rewarding better links rather than just more links. They're things around user and usage data, which Google previously didn't use a whole lot of signals around that. Same story with user experience. Same story with things like pogo sticking, which is probably one of the ways that they're measuring some of that stuff.
</p><p>If we were to scatter plot it, we'd probably see something like this, where the better your brand performs as a brand, the higher and better it tends to perform in the rankings of Google search engine.
</p><h3>How does brand correlate to ranking signals?</h3><p>Now, how is it that these brand signals that I'm talking about correlate more directly to ranking signals? Like why does this impact and influence? I think if we understand that, we can understand why we need to invest in brand and branding and where to invest in it as it relates to the web marketing kinds of things that we do for SEO.
</p><p>One very clearly and very frankly is links. So when we talk about the links that Google wants to measure, wants to count today, those are organic, editorially earned links. They're not manipulative. They weren't bought. They tend not to be cajoled, they're earned.
</p><p><img src="./Is Brand a Google Ranking Factor_ - Whiteboard Friday - Moz_files/5567a0ea548316.72429252.jpg">
</p><p>Because of that, one of the best ways that folks have been earning links is to get people to come to their website and then have some fraction, some percentage of those folks naturally link to them without having to do any extra effort. It's basically like, “Hey, you made this great piece of content or this great product or great service or great data. Therefore, I'm going to reference it." Granted, that's a small percentage of people. There's still only maybe two or three out of a hundred folks who might visit your website on the Internet who actually have the power or ability to link to you because they control content on the web as opposed to just social sharing.
</p><p>But when that happens, in a lot of cases folks go and they say, "Hmm, yeah, this content's good, but I've never heard of this brand before. I'm not sure if I should recommend it. It looks good, but I don't know them." Versus, "Oh, I love these folks. This is like one of my favorite companies or brands or products or experiences, and this content is great. I am totally going to link to it." Because that happens, even if that difference is small, even if the percent goes from 1% to 2%, well now, guess what? For every hundred visits, you're earning twice the links of your non-branded competitor.
</p><h3>Social signals</h3><p>These are pretty much exactly the same thing. Folks who visit content, who have experiences with a company, with a product, or with a service, if they're familiar and comfortable with the brand, if they want to evangelize that brand, then guess what? You're going to get more social sharing per visit, per exposure than you would ordinarily, and that's going to lead to a cycle of more social sharing which leads to visits which probably leads to links.
</p><h3>User and usage data</h3><p>It's also true that brand is going to impact user and usage data. So one of the most interesting patents, which we'll probably be talking about in a future Whiteboard Friday, was brought up recently by Bill Slawski and looked at user and usage data. It was just granted to Google in the last month. It talked about how Google would look at the patterns of where web visitors would go and what their search experiences would be like. It would potentially say, "Hey, Google would like to reward sites that are getting organic traffic, not just from search, but traffic of all kinds on a particular topic."
</p><p>So if it turns out that lots of people who are researching a vacation to Costa Rica end up going to Oyster.com, well, Google might say, "Hey, you know what? We've seen this pattern over and over again. Let's boost Oyster.com's rankings because it seems like people who look for this kind of content end up on this site. Not necessarily directly through us, through Google. They might end up on it through social media, through organic web links, through direct visits, through e-mail marketing, whatever it is."
</p><p><img src="./Is Brand a Google Ranking Factor_ - Whiteboard Friday - Moz_files/5567a115706485.21434962.jpg">
</p><p>When you're unbranded, one of the few ways that you can get traffic is through unbranded search. Search is one of those few channels that does drive traffic, or historically anyway did drive traffic to a lot of non-branded, less branded sites. Brands tend to earn traffic from a wide variety of sources. If you can start earning traffic from lots of sources and have the retention and the experience to drive people back again and again, well, probably you're going to benefit from some of these potential algorithmic shifts and future looking directions that Google's got.
</p><h3>Click-through rates</h3><p>Same story a little bit when it comes to click-through rate. Now, we know from experience and testing that click-through rate is or appears to have a very direct impact on rankings. If lots of people are performing a search and they click on your website in position number four or five, and they're not clicking on position one, two, or three, you can bet that you're going to be moving up those rankings very, very quickly.
</p><p>Granted there is some manipulative services out there that try and automate this. Some of them work for a little while. Most of them get shut down pretty quick. I wouldn't recommend investing in those. But I do recommend investing in brand, because when you have a recognizable brand, searchers are going to come here and they're going to go, "Oh, that one, maybe I haven't heard of it. That one, I've heard of it. That one, I haven't heard of it."
</p><p><img src="./Is Brand a Google Ranking Factor_ - Whiteboard Friday - Moz_files/5567a1b6e96853.58321653.jpg">
</p><p>Guess what they're clicking on? The one they're already familiar with. The one they have a positive association with already. This is the power of brand advertising, and I think it's one of the big reasons why you've seen case studies from folks like Seer Interactive, talking about how a radio ad campaign or a billboard ad campaign seemed to have a positive lift in their SEO work as well. This phenomenon is going to mean that you're benefiting from every searcher who looks for something, even if you rank further down, if you're the better known brand.
</p><p>So is brand a ranking factor? No, it's not. Is brand something that positively impacts SEO? Almost certainly in every niche, yes, it is.
</p><p>All right. Looking forward to some great comments. I'll try and jump in there and answer any questions that I can. If you have experiences you want to share, we'd love to hear from you. Hopefully, we'll see you again next week for another edition of Whiteboard Friday. Take care.

      <p></p><p>Rand, great Whiteboard Friday -- I completely agree that "brand" is not a quantifiable metric (and therefore not a ranking factor) but that big brands have high rankings that come from the associated elements the come with good branding.</p>

<p>1.) Large companies have advertising, marketing, and PR departments that work 24/7 to <em>get people talking about them</em> via news coverage, online discussions, social media channels, and more. And all of that results in countless links that are 100% natural and 100% authoritative as by-products -- which, of course, helps rankings.</p>

<p>2.) Large companies indeed also have the resources to invest in UX. And that's become increasingly important. I summarize SEO with this line: <em>Build, promote, and publicize a website that delights its target audience</em>. I don't want to embarrass our humble hosts, but Moz is a great example. I'm a digital marketer -- and Moz is my favorite digital marketing website because here I can read the best digital marketing guides and essays, ask questions in the best digital Q&amp;A forum, and more. If your target audience is people who like widgets, then build a website that delights people who like widgets in whatever way would appeal to them. It's <em>building a brand</em> among your target audience.</p>

<p>One basic example I like to give: Take the query "best restaurants in Chicago" -- I'd bet that Google's goal is not for the SERPs to reflect that top ten restaurant websites based on keywords or links. I'd wager that Google's goal is for the SERPs to reflect what the human beings who live in Chicago think are the top ten restaurants. And that comes from having the best food and the best prices and the best staff and the best atmosphere -- and then getting the online news coverage and reviews and discussions that reflect all of that. You know, <em>building a brand</em>.</p>

<p>In the end, it all goes back to the common refrain that I probably repeat all-too-often: Stop thinking about building high rankings directly and start thinking about building brands -- the rankings will come as by-products. (Assuming all of the technical SEO stuff has been done first.)</p>

<p>In my opinion, Google is an algorithm that wants to think like a human being. So, "marketing to Google" and "marketing to human beings" is increasingly becoming the same thing as Google becomes smarter and smarter. So, we need to build brands among human beings that <em>deserve</em> to rank highly.</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Very, very well summarized Samuel. I think for the SEO community and for SEO professionals, our job is to try and get as close to understanding not only Google's final behavior (the rankings), but their process too (the algorithms that power that behavior and the data upon which they operate). Knowing what elements of branding can directly vs. indirectly influence human behavior and search engine behavior is what we strive for, and part of what I wanted to start the conversation about in this video.</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Totally agreed with Samuel here, if the brands accompanied with a complete digital marketing tactics and staff (SEO, SEM, SMM) go for it then it would be almost impossible to defeat them in SERPS, which in most of the cases does not happen (at least it is going to take some time in Sub-continent). PR Activities and traditional marketing channels already provide them with enough exposure, mentions (social shares/links) and in conjunction with proper SEO they would be flawless.  </p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Really smart here to link the idea of offline marketing (you mentioned billboard advertising) and SEO influence. One of the first questions we ask prospective clients is what other forms of marketing they are doing - or will be doing. A good brand will stand the test of time, becomes more trusted, more talked about and shared.</p>

<p>Focussing on brand also helps people to steer away from spammy SEO tactics because you're always asking the question: is this activity good for our brand awareness and image? If the answer is 'probably not' then don't do that thing</p>

<p>Simples :)</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Agreed. And, I think we're going to see more and more case studies of branding activity boosting search rankings and SEO results (CTR, engagement rates, conversion rates, etc). The reality is that increased branding creates increased trust (when done right), and more trust means more clicks, conversions, and happy visitors, which is precisely what Google wants to accomplish in the SERPs.</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Hey Rand,</p>

<p>After the updates of penguin and panda it is seen that Google favors brands because of the reasons you stated above also because of trust (Big Brand maintains it well).  Do you think there is something called trust rank that is used by Google as stated by Bill <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/2009/10/google-trust-rank-patent-granted/" rel="nofollow">http://www.seobythesea.com/2009/10/google-trust-ra...</a> ?<br><br>Also, I think best practice on Branding would be using Branded anchor texts and using the keywords as co-occurrence i,e placing keywords around the branded anchor texts  and adding some trusted sites (co-citation with your site) (though it is important that whole content is valuable to user), will that be a help <a href="http://www.semrush.com/blog/link-building-what-are-co-citation-and-co-occurrence/" rel="nofollow">http://www.semrush.com/blog/link-building-what-are...</a> ?</p>

<p>Whats your thought on using Brand with co-citation &amp; co-occurrence?</p>

      <p></p><p>This is something I have been thinking about a lot this week due to an experience I have just had.</p>

<p>I have a client who is very much an unknown brand and are just starting out with their SEO. They recently popped in Google for a seriously competitive keyword. We sorted out their on-site SEO a few months back and recently selected a particularly profitable topic area to try and push. At this time the rankings for the keywords in this topic area were sat pages and pages back in Google.</p>

<p>We decided to use some PPC for a quick hit which started to convert seriously well for our spend and all of a sudden the SEO ranking comes through for said highly competitive keyword a few days later. We aren't just talking page three either, we popped all the way up to page one in organic SERPs. There isn't any links pointing to the page and yet we are sat there on page one in the organic results alongside some massive brands.  We can see that the products being sold due to organic traffic are all related to this topic area and is therefore sending some great signals that people are liking what they see on our page.<br></p>

<p>So I do believe that even if you are a smaller brand, if you are converting well then you do have a chance to rank alongside the big players. If you sell a good quality product on a site with a good user experience and your selling for a good price which keeps Google users happy enough to part with their cash, it would make sense that Google would want you to rank no matter how big your brand is.  </p>

<p>Happy Friday folks :)</p>

      <p></p><p>Wait, are you saying that your organic rankings jumped a lot directly following a well-converting AdWords campaign? If so, then the implications are enormous and I'm sure a lot of people will have a lot to say about that! :)</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Well, it does make sense, doesn't it? A well converting PPC campaign will boost the overall performance of a page/set of pages and brand awareness will go up. This should create more traffic from direct, e-mail (if they signed up for newsletter when they bought) and social (if they go to like the page). <br><br>Then you'll end up getting the signals that Rand is talking about here, shouldn't that result in higher rankings?<br><br></p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>But the implication would be that people could essentially pay for higher rankings by running AdWords campaigns (that would still need to convert well).</p>

<p>The other thing is that ad campaigns typically send people to a landing page and not to a website as a whole. So, the conversion rate of a landing page would have little to do with Google's judging of the "branding" and UX of the website as a whole.</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>I agree on that point, absolutely. So I'm not saying PPC = Higher organic rankings. But if you have some good campaigns running it will boost your user and usage stats indirectly. If they like you enough to come back (which will probably happen through another channel than PPC) then you get more signals from there and if Google truly uses these signals (which it sure seems like) then that would likely end up in higher rankings.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>In my personal opinion PPC is just like any other marketing channel as it helps you create brand awareness and through that it will boost your organic rankings.<br></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Edit: I agree on that, it's not the first interaction that I think plays a part in boosting rankings. It's what happens after there's been a conversion through the PPC ad. If it was a good experience, then what are you going to do the next time you need products of that kind? You go directly/search for brand name? You go on their social profiles? <br><br>Heck, maybe you even recognize their brand name when you do an unbranded search and click on them because of that? Then you end up with the brand as a ranking factor as Rand described here.</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Hello,</p>

<p>Interesting conversation here :)</p>

<p>Samuel, I am sure you are absolutely right that a lot of people would have a lot to say about a well converting PPC campaign impacting the SEO rankings!  I never really held an opinion about it until I saw this eyebrow raising incident this week with what we did.  I'm going to test it on another part of the site and see what happens - but of course the product offering is going to have to be bang on or else it is not a fair experiment. </p>

<p>I'm going to ask this question in fear it might be a stupid one but I'm going to ask it anyway.  If you don't have e-commerce/goals/event tracking collecting nice data in GA, does this actually hamper your progress in the SERPs because they cannot see what is going on conversion wise? Just a thought, but it makes sense to me.</p>

      <p></p><p>Re: which data Google uses. I think when they say "we don't use GA data to calculate rankings" they're not lying, they simply have other and better ways to collect all that (Google Chrome usage, Android usage, data from wifi and from ISPs, data from people visiting pages from SERPs and returning, data from pages that host Google ads, etc). IMO, we should assume any behavioral data from web users can be seen and interpreted by Google at this point without needing to touch GA.</p>

<p>As for AdWords positively affecting SEO - I've seen examples in the past that looked correlated, but were never causal (e.g. shutting off the AdWords campaigns didn't tank rankings). If I had to guess, I'd say this might not be about AdWords per se, but about the optimization work you did to make that pages/those pages work well for visitors. Google saw the change, boosted the rankings short term (which they often do with pages that rank in the top 50-100 and get changed), saw high CTR and high engagement/user satisfaction, and now you continue to rank well.</p>

<p>That's just a theory, but it's one that could also fit the data.</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Totally agree with Rand on this. The PPC campaign was a great way to get your name/brand out there but the site/product you are working on must be a product people love plus you must have did some great SEO work ;) </p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Rand, I'd have to find the data on a computer I don't use any longer but back maybe 3-4 years ago I did a very narrow experiment on Adwords helping SEO - I would LOVE to redo it in a few months when I get a bit of time.</p>

<p>The test was:  Take 2 sites brand new. Put similar but obviously not duplicate content on both, build a few directory links (same ones, similar content) I did everything as even as possible except I started a $20 a day Adwords campaign on one for some really cheap keyphrases. I was getting about 500-1000 hits a day (.02 - .04 per click).  </p>

<p>I ran this test for about 3 weeks and turned it off. Nothing had changed in the results. The sites were virtually even for similar keyphrases and they were both "mid page 8" type results. </p>

<p>Then I turned Display network on for one site and left the other off. The Display site went up to page 2 in about a week. It stayed there for(ever) as long as I left the sites up. Eventually they were deleted in a purge.</p>

<p>I am not going to go as far as say "it helped" - what I know &amp; remember is all I have left. But I'm very certain that the site with Display network on was the site that flew up +5-6 pages/50-60 ranks. </p>

<p>IMEC maybe? </p>

<p>Again, I'm not making the claim that it helps ... but it appeared to help me with no other interference on a stable-ish site. At the time, my best guess was that the way some webmasters were displaying their Adsense / display ads, it was acting almost as a "follow" link. Maybe if they had a dofollow plugin or were somehow force-overriding nofollow, etc?  I really don't know. </p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>I also had this discussion a few times, and in my opinion a very strong factor here is the branded queries volume which is often affected by PPC campaigns.</p>

<p>So let's say a completely new site (at SITE.com) was just launched. And it is simply GREAT. It provides a great user experience and real value to any new visitor. The only problem? Nobody knows yet it exists.</p>

<p>From all the options the company has to start with, they decide to start with an Adwords campaign. Spending tens of thousands of dollars every single day for the next 30 days.</p>

<p>Some of the users who are exposed to SITE.com today, love it so much that they decide to get back to it tomorrow once again. Directly, or through a branded search.</p>

<p>I believe that this exponential increase in branded queries is the main factor that affects rankings in short periods of time. Even before the first links/social signals appear.</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>I also felt the same way but little bit more digging dipper, that reversed my views. The Higher organic visits while running PPC campaign is probably due to last attribution model of analytics. So a user clicked once on ad and landed on website then after personalisation and search history start working to give organic visits. My analysis is based on also practical. More visits through PPC also increases the organic visits while reduce in PPC budget also reduces organic visits.</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Hi Rand,</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Ok, so I've been having people tease me on Facebook and Twitter about how my name is misspelled in the transcript on this week's whiteboard Friday, however Rand, your pronunciation of my last name was perfect, so it's all OK (even better than that - it's an honor to be mentioned in a positive tone on a WBF). I do appreciate the mention, and I have a guess at which patent you are talking about, and I'm excited to hear that you're considering spending more of a whiteboard Friday involving the topic behind that one. If I have the right patent in mind, it's definitely worth talking about, and I'm looking forward to it.<br><br>Brands likely are not the subject of too many discussions between search engineers at Google, but if brand builders are doing their job well, and people who work with them help to create a mindset that permeates their company, and surrounds how people think of them and write/talk about them, that can have a positive impact.  We likely do see how Google treats specific entities in queries and search results as being special, and since a brand is an entity, that does happen to them. Build a brand, and Google may treat your business as a unique entity and provide you with a knowledge panel, and other indications that they recognize the uniqueness of your brand. That's a good outcome in most instances.  Follow that up by finding ways for Google to associate quality and authority with your business, and that's even better.<br><br>Again, thanks.<br><br>Bill<br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Sorry about that Bill! Looks like it was fixed before I even woke up this morning :-) Totally agree with you on these fronts - Google's search engineers probably aren't saying "how do we rank bigger brands higher?" but are much more likely to say "how do we get results more searchers like, trust, prefer, and are delighted by into the results?" The odd thing about human behavior is that familiarity and trust (which branding can create) will lead us to prefer known brands in results, and thus, Google inevitably observes those patterns and their algorithms begin to conform to our psychological preferences.</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>No problems on the name, Rand. It's fixed now, and alright.<br><br>I remember shopping with my father for a DVD Player once, and watching him choose a Sony DVD Player over one that was half the cost, with the same or better features, and asking him why he didn't choose the less expensive model. He told me, "I've heard of Sony, and I like their products."  That's the kind of loyalty you hope to build as a brand. I suspect that also leads to more links and more clicks as well.</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Great WBF, Rand!<br><br>I think you are spot on with this, as it has become obvious now that social signals and engagement are huge when it comes to ranking. I couldn't help but wonder though, is there a correlation between search volume on "brandname" and ranking? That would be a way to indicate to Google that a lot of people want to see search results from this brand, couldn't that play a role in their overall ranking then?<br></p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>I think Cyrus and Matt Peters from Moz's team will be trying to measure/correlate this in our Search Ranking Factors update this year. Should be cool to see what they come up with!</p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>Maybe it is time for the good old commercial advertisers technique to repeat your brand once you have the attention of your visitors. You reapeat it in the content of you web site, so that it is hard to forget this name. And next time this visitor might go to the search engine like Google and enters in the search box something like this: "brandname + keyword" Which might give you even an extra boost as a ranking signal (I guess).<br><br>And thank you Rand for your superb Whiteboard Friday. I love them. Rand is my Brand!<br><br></p><p></p>

      <p></p><p>I strongly defend that SEO + Social Media (and, of course, other marketing channels) help us build our digital presence, our digital identity. We must remember the importance of structured data in this 'building effort'. Making connections, giving coherence to our presence (same data on different platforms, not contradictory info) and offering a solid identity (aka 'entity'; call it 'brand', 'person name' or whatever you like) are ways (well, this mix is a way) to earn credit from users who, thanks to our hard work, will probably become our future evangelists.</p>

<p>Thanks for this great WBF, Rand.</p><p></p>
