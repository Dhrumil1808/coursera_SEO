<p>Nice post, it is indeed amazing how a basic on page SEO can help you rank somewhere in Google, and whenever you start publishing content in other websites and get a natural backlinks flow, jeez it just boosts into the first results. It is MANDATORY to have a basic on page SEO!</p>

<p>Great Article about SEO basics. From my personal experience, optimizing the load time of your images and website speed in general has always helped me to increase rankings.</p><p>What i missed so far in this article was a paragraph about optimizing the inner urls without falling into overoptimization.</p><p>Anyways, nice read. Keep it up!</p>

<p>Hi James,</p><p>It was a concise article. Covered the basics associated with On page SEO very well! Such an article will be very handy for newbies, who are trying to get a grip over On page SEO!</p><p>I must admit that #9 and #10 are two aspects that many bloggers overlook. They don't take it as SEO aspect at all!</p><p>But little do they realize that Google and other Search engines really value mobile friendliness and page speed!</p><p>I found the link to this post on Kingged. Will be Kingging it there! :)</p><p>Arun</p>
